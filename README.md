# Uber-Ride-Predictor
Uber Ride Predictor is a python code for predicting the uber rides using Data Science and Machine Learning Algorithms.

In this code, I'm using Numpy, pandas,Matpltlib, sklearn and pickle libraries 
Then uploading Data of Taxi Rides which we'll be using for prediction.
And using Linear Regression algoithm of ML on Data set.
